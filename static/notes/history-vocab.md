# History and Vocabulary of AI

## Early History

The field largely originated from Alan Turing's 1950 paper, in which he detailed a test (called the Turing test) to determine if computers are intelligent. The idea is that if a computer can convince a human that it is a human, the computer is intelligent.

This idea of thinking being symbolic manipulation was popular throughout the 1950s.

## Intelligent Agents

An **intelligent agent** is defined as:

> A system or program that perceives and interacts with its environment while making informed decisions to achieve a certain goal or maximize some utility.

Here, "perceives" can be any input, such as text, sensors, or signals. The word "interacts" refers to actions the agent takes, like physical movement, producing some output, writing text, or generating an image. Agents are "informed" through training data in machine learning, reinforcement learning, or a search algorithm. Finally, agents make decisions based on probability, objective functions, fairness, or biases.

## Categories of AI

### Observability

Environments are **fully observable** if the agents know everything about the environment (such as seeing a maze from the top). Otherwise, they are **partially observable** if they have a limited view of the world (such as self-driving vehicles).

### Number of Agents

A **single agent** AI only involves one intelligent agent, whereas a **multiagent** AI involves multiple agents are assumed to communicate with one another.

### Determinism

An AI is **deterministic** if it always produces the same output given the same input and **nondeterministic** if it could produce multiple outputs given the same input.

### Decision Dependence

An AI system is **episodic** if each decision is independent of one another, and **sequential** if there is a temporal dependency.

### Changing Environment

The environment is **static** if it is unchanging or **dynamic** if it can change.

### Types of Actions

If the agent can only take certain actions, it is **discrete**. If the agent can take any range of actions, it is **continuous**.

### Environmental Knowledge

The rules of the environment may either be **known** or **unknown**.
